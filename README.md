  The cross-modal multitask learning framework.
</p>


This framework addresses the quantitative characterization of apparent quality defects in infrastructure by proposing a novel cross-modal multitask learning network. It effectively integrates the strengths of image-based defect detection and point cloud-based measurement. Defect pixels identified in images are precisely mapped to their corresponding 3D coordinates in the point cloud through dense feature matching. Leveraging prior knowledge of defect properties, a tailored measurement strategy is developed to accurately quantify the area and volume of defects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness in detection, matching, and measurement tasks, providing strong technical support for the quantitative assessment of infrastructure defects.
